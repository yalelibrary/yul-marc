=245  10$aHenry Lewis Stimson papers,$f1846-1966 (inclusive).
=300  \\$a148.75 linear feet.$f(368 boxes)
=351  \\$aArranged in fourteen series and two additions:  I. Correspondence. II. Memoranda, Minutes of Meetings.  III. Speeches, Writings, Statements.  IV. Special Subjects.  V. Family Papers.  VI. Selected Documents of the State Department.  VII. Trips to Europe.  VIII. Correspondence, Speeches, and Writings of Others.  IX. Office of the Secretary of War.  X. Printed Matter.  XI. Newspaper Clippings.  XII. Business, Financial, and Legal Papers.  XIII. Photographs.  XIV. Diaries.
=520  \\$aThe papers consist of correspondence, letter books, speeches, articles, letters to the editor, statements prepared for presentation to Congress and substantial subject files with clippings, printed matter, reports, memoranda and photographs related to Henry Stimson's various public offices.  While the official records of Stimson's service (as Secretary of War under President Taft, Secretary of State under Herbert Hoover and as Secretary of War in the cabinets of Presidents Roosevelt and Truman) are all in the National Archives, the substantial correspondence, as well as other papers, in this collection provide important records of his activities as a private citizen and in office and on special missions.  His work in Latin America in helping to settle a dispute between Chile and Peru in 1926, and as the United States representative seeking to bring an end to a civil war in Nicaragua in 1927 is shown in the papers with first-hand reports and background material.
=520  8\$aExtensive family papers include the correspondence (1846-1966) of Stimson's parents, sister, and other relatives.  In his father's papers are a series of diaries (1864-1916).  There is also a collection of letters by Stimson to his wife and to other family members.
=520  8\$aHis service as Secretary of State under Hoover (1929-1933) is particularly well documented with memoranda of conversations with foreign diplomatic representatives, and briefing books presenting background information on foreign affairs for the period.  Of major importance are Stimson's diaries which span the years 1904-1945, covering the entire period of his public career and including references to the early stages of the development of the atom bomb.
