=545  \\$aThis collection documents the 1886 Haymarket trial in Chicago, in which eight men were convicted of the murder of a police officer after a bomb exploded during a labor demonstration in Haymarket Square on May 4, 1886. While most admitted to being anarchists, none was proven to have thrown the bomb. August Spies, Albert Parsons, George Engel, and Adolph Fischer were hanged on November 11, 1887; Michael Schwab and Samuel Fielden were sentenced to life imprisonment; Oscar Neebe was sentenced to fifteen years hard labor. Louis Lingg, also sentenced to hang, committed suicide on November 10, 1887. In 1893, Illinois Governor John P. Altgeld pardoned Schwab, Fielden, and Neebe, on the grounds that the eight accused men did not receive a fair trail.
=545  \\$aThe prosecution was headed by Illinois State's Attorney Julius Sprague Grinnell. Grinnell was born in Massena, New York, and graduated from Middlebury College in 1866. He was admitted to the bar in New York State in 1868. In 1870 he moved to Chicago, where he was elected State's Attorney in 1884. After a term as a judge in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, following the Haymarket trial, he retired into private practice.
=520  \\$aTrial evidence is chiefly in German, and consists of manuscripts, correspondence, leaflets, and other items seized from the offices of the Arbeiter-Zeitung, a publication of the International Working People's Association, with which many of the defendants were involved. The manuscripts are chiefly holograph drafts of editorials by August Spies and Michael Schwab; much of the correspondence is to Spies, including several letters from Johann Most, editor of the New York paper Die Freiheit. The evidence also includes other socialist and anarchist newspapers, as well as fragments of the bomb that exploded in Haymarket Square.
=520  \\$aPapers of the State's Attorney's Office include Grinnell's notes and drafts of legal briefs prepared for the trial and for the defense's appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court in 1887. These include a draft letter from a police spy to Lucy Parsons, Albert Parsons's wife. Also present are personal papers of Grinnell: most relate directly to the trial while others document his later career. The collection also contains printed ephemera of the socialist and anarchist movements, including a number of items relating specifically to the Haymarket affair. Among these are cabinet card photographs of six of the eight convicted men.
=520  \\$aThe bulk of the collection consists of the papers of State's Attorney Julius Grinnell. These include trial evidence, notes and drafts of legal briefs, personal papers, and printed ephemera. A few items were added to Grinnell's papers in the 1950s-60s by collector Frederick B. Adams.
